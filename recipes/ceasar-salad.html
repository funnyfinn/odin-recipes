    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The Caesar salad is one of the most famous salads in the world! Why is it called Caesar Salad? It seems to have been invented in the 1920s by an Italian chef who emigrated to the United States, Cesare Cardini, and started as a side dish of romaine lettuce, golden croutons, and Parmigiano flakes. Over time, this recipe has literally traveled the world and has been enriched with other ingredients, such as grilled chicken breast or crispy bacon, thus becoming a delicious main dish. What must certainly not be missing is the dressing, a creamy sauce to dress the salad, flavored with mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and, if desired, anchovies. Here we explain how to prepare the Caesar salad in both versions, with and without chicken: the first will be perfect for a fresh summer lunch, while the second is excellent to accompany your favorite dishesâ€¦ the choice is yours and, of course, enjoy!</p>
